  - Packages for openSUSE:
    - Tumbleweed: the package is part of the main repo-oss repository, so it can be easily installed with `sudo zypper in ART`
    - Leap 15.x: the package resides in the `graphics` OBS repository, so to install it a few extra steps are needed. First you need to install opi, the OBS package manager, with `sudo zypper in opi`, and then you can install ART `sudo opi ART`.
